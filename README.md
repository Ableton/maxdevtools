# Max device development tools

## Summary

This repository includes resources and tools we use at Ableton when building and maintaining Max devices.

* [Max for Live Production Guidelines](m4l-production-guidelines/m4l-production-guidelines.md) - A collection of suggestions that we recommend keeping in mind in when sharing your Max device.
* [Ableton's patch code standard](patch-code-standard/patch-code-standard.md) - The patch code standard that Ableton uses for the devices that come with Live.
* [maxdiff](maxdiff/README.md) - A way to get readable git diffs for Max devices and Max patch files.

These are aimed at experienced Max for Live builders. To get started with Max for Live, please have a look at the [Building Max Devices](https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/building-max-devices/) Pack.
